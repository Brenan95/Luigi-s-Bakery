        <h1 class="center">Welcome to Luigi's Bakery Website</h1>
        <p class="center">A wonderful local bakery with housemade pastries and cakes</p>

        <h2 class="floatleft">A. Documentation of the Development Process</h2>
        <p class="floatleft">The intent and purpose behind the website was to design a bakery site that had helpful</p>
        <p class="floatleft">information and was interactive. This was part of my final assignment in my IT270 class</p>
        <p class="floatleft">at Southern New Hampshire University. The prompt being to design a website for my uncle</p>
        <p class="floatleft">that looks professional and shows proficiency with HTML and CSS. I spent the last few weeks</p>
        <p class="floatleft">editing and organizing the code in a way to make it flow and work the way I needed it to.</p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="floatleft">B. Defense of the Final Product</h2>
        <img src="images/Code .jpg" alt="code" class="Imageright" />
        <p class="floatleft">I wanted the website to have a casual feel while also having features that display the bakeries</p>
        <p class="floatleft">best attributes, which is the food. I chose to go with a background that is a creamy yellow and</p>
        <p class="floatleft">went well with the logo colors, as well as the footer and headers. I didnâ€™t want the font to be too</p>
        <p class="floatleft">busy on the page so I went with arial to give a nice clean look. I chose to make the font a maroon color</p>
        <p class="floatleft">to go with the color scheme of the website and stand out nicely against the creamy yellow. I read that the</p>
        <p class="floatleft">colors yellow and red had psychological effects on viewers and were supposed to trigger hunger responses in</p>
        <p class="floatleft">the brain. I figured if I set my website up with these colors it might just get the bakery more business.</p>
        <p class="floatleft">I was trying to think of the general audience of and who would be using the website so I wanted to make it</p>
        <p class="floatleft">friendly and intuitive for all ages. There might be elderly who want to use the website to order so I wanted</p>
        <p class="floatleft">it to be minimally usable with few clickable options to keep it simple.</p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="floatleft">C. Opportunities for Improvement and Growth</h2>
        <p class="floatleft">I kind of want to develop the overall look of the website more and add other features that could</p>
        <p class="floatleft">make the ordering process more efficient. I feel I could have done the layout differently with</p>
        <p class="floatleft">more time and made it even more interactive.Content wise I might want to add a menu to the</p>
        <p class="floatleft">website to give customers a chance to look things over and decide what they want.</p>
